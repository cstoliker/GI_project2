	Farmer Jeb has a problem on his hands.  One of his farm animals is stealing crops in the middle of the night.  Whichever animal it is, theyâ€™ve become quite crafty, as Jeb is unable to figure out which one is committing the heinous act.  He wants to humanely remove the criminal from his farmland and has hired you, a Private Detective, to help him in this matter.  Explore the farm, gather clues, and help Farmer Jeb rid his life of the thief!

Post-Mortem

1. Did you fail to implement any features you planned in your design document? Why?

Yes, in the design document, I included additional animals, as well as a time limit and ultimately had a more robust plan for this game.
I guess I fell short mostly do to time constraints.  As with most students, I wanted to make sure I got the requirements finished before I worried about anything else. 

2. Did you make any improvements to the systems of your game over the course of
implementation? How did you decide to make these changes?

Yes. Multiple components of this game overwent changes throughout developement.  Specifically, the npc controls, the player controls, and the generation for the environment.  Some changes came out of necessity, others were added to make the mechanics of the game match the design of the game.

3. If you were to continue development on this game, do you have any planned improvements
or new features?

Yes, I would like to randomize the culprit or at least add new levels.  Currently the culprit is always the same.  I'd also like to add variations in the ground design so its not just a flay plane.  Lastly, I'd like to upgrade all of the art I've created for this game.
